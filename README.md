# Ludkerno

Little Game FrameWork made with C++ with SDL2.

To use the third party folder libs you will need to install mingw/MSYS2.
then compile using ```make Release_x86```

You can make your own environment using cmake. For windows you can use with Mingw/GCC and MSVC.

For Linux you can use the following steps:

```$ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev && sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev```

Feel free to add support to linux on cmakelist.

Dependencies: [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php), [SDL2_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) and [RadiPako](https://github.com/malysonb/RadiPako).
