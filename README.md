# Ludkerno

Little Game FrameWork made with C++ with SDL2.

To use the third party folder libs you will need to install mingw.
then compile using ```make Release_x86```

For while i'm trying to support windows 32bits.
But you can compile on linux by the way, you just need to install SDL2 and SDL2_image libs.

This source code comes with a little demo game:
